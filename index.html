      <ul style="list-style:none">
        <li>
          &bull; Searching for pupperoni treats when the lights are out (you can hear her <i>sniff sniff</i>ing)
        </li>
        <li>
            &bull; Playing keep away when she has a rawhide bone.
        </li>
        <li>
            &bull; Walks, of course!
        </li>
      </ul>
          <h2>Who is Lucy?</h2>
          <p style="width: 400px; margin: auto;">Lucy enjoys long walks and cuddling. My best guess is she is a mix of a Jack Russell and a Terrier, and is 13 years old. She has lots of energy and gets excited often even at her old age.<br><br><br></p>
